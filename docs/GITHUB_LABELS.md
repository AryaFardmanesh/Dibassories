## 🧭 Label Rules
- Use **one `type:`** label per issue/PR.  
- Combine with `status:` and `priority:` when relevant.  
- Use `good first issue` only with clear context.  
- Unsure? → Use `status: discussion`.

---

## 🗂️ Versioning
We use **Milestones** (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.0.0`) instead of version labels to track releases.

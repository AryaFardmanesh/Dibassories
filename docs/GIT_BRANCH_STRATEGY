# Git Branch Strategy

This document defines the Git branching model for the project.  
It keeps development organized and ensures stability across versions.

## Branches

```txt
main
├── current
│   ├── others
````

* **`main`** → Stable, production-ready code.
* **`current`** → Active development branch (features, fixes, updates).
* **`others`** → Temporary or feature-specific branches merged into `current`.

## Merge Flow

```txt
others → current → main
```

* Do **not** merge directly from `others` to `main`.
* Test and review all changes before merging.

## 🧭 About the Project

This website allows users to:
- Register and log in to their account  
- Browse jewelry products (rings, necklaces, earrings, etc.)  
- Add items to their shopping cart and complete purchases  
- Sellers can list new products for sale  
- Admins can manage accounts, products, and orders  

The focus of the project is on **functionality**, **clean database design**, and **clear documentation** rather than production-level scalability.
